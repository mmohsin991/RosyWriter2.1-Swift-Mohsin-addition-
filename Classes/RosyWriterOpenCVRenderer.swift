// To build OpenCV into the project:
//	- Download opencv2.framework for iOS
//	- Insert framework into project's Frameworks group
//	- Make sure framework is included under the target's Build Phases -> Link Binary With Libraries.
//-> Not needed in Swift version.
// Original Objective-C++ version only utilizes cv::Mat for wrapping the CVPixelBuffer's pixel data,
// which cannot be imported to Swift. So we created a compatible struct in Swift.
// Thus, this example uses no OpenCV features and you need not link opencv2.framework .
